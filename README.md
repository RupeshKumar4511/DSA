# Data Structures : 
It is an way to store and organize data efficiently.
<br>
Here efficiently means (minimum time and space)



# Array:
1. array objects are stored in heap.
2. As heap objects are not continuous so array may not be continuous .It depends on the JVM.


<br>
<br>
3. In array of objects like array containing String value , each the elements in the array is itself a object and it is saved in different locations in heap memory and these elements providing the reference to the array.

# Algorithm :
It is the steps to solve a particular problem.

# Time Complexity :
It is measures of how running time of an algorithm increases with the size of input data.
<br>

Important Point :
Time Complexity of a good Algorithm should be in O(log n) to O(1) where O is Big O notation.
Time Complexity always depends on the no of steps in an algorithm.


# 3 Steps for Recursion :
1. find the base case.
<br>
2. find the relation between problems(outer method) and subproblems(inner method which wiil be called in the the same outer merhod).
<br>
3. Generalise the relation.
